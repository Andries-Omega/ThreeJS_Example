        So to begin this procedure, i am just typing up random words that come
        to my mind so i can see some stuff in my web app, i hope you stay
        patient with me during this out of control rambling you weirdo, i am
        joking..... lol. but this shit is really fire though. All my future
        projects from now on must have a touch of 3 js
